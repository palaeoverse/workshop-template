# Materials

In this directory, we organise the materials for the workshop. 

Each unit of a workshop has a dedicated folder for all materials relating to that specific unit.

Folders can be renamed and reorganised as desired (including the addition of new subfolders). However, it is recommended that each unit has a designated folder for materials, and the folder name is consistent with the respective `.qmd` file.
